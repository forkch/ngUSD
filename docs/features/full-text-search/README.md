# Full Text Search

The full text search enables user to use any textual information inside the Scenarioo documentation and to find use cases, scenarios, steps where the searched text occurs.

Text can be searched inside:
* use case and scenario descriptions and meta information
* steps and pages meta information
* in visible text on screens as well as in HTMl source code of the screens (as long as you write this information, e.g. into the field `visibleText` on steps for visible text)
