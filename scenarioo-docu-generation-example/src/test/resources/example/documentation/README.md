# Example Reference Scenarioo Data

The folder `scenariooDocuExample` contains a commited full version of the generated example data by the example data generator.

This demonstrates the structure of data that scenarioo writers can generate and the scenarioo viewer webapp can import/process and display.

This example was produced by running the scenarioo-docu-generation-example and is also the same data that is used for our demo on the demo server.

We only copy the regenerated data (from build directory) to here from time to time and commit it here - typically this is done before a release, also to cross check that we didnt change something in the format that is undesired.
